# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Contract

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. To what goals do we all commit?

  We all commit to cooperating with each other and finishing our work punctually. We also want to make the client happy while meeting the audience's goals.

2. What are our "ground rules"? (Don't make an exhaustive listâ€”stick with just a few.)

    **Tip:** Interrupting another person can make them feel like their option isn't valued. Consider a rule about interrupting.

   - Completing our parts at the agreed time.
   - Let other members know ahead of time if you can't complete it


3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    Once a week in person every Sunday at 8:30pm and we will schedule additional meetings over zoom during the week is necessary. We will also meet in person during our discussion time.

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

     We will coomunicate with the client through zoom meetings or through direct text messages when necessary.


5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**No "coder" or "designer" roles are permitted;** everyone must design and code.)

    **Tip:** It's often helpful to think of **responsibilities** rather than roles here.

    - Communicator: Keeps in contact with the client and updates them
    - Leader: Initiates meeting and schedules meeting
    - Reviewer: Make sure everyone does their part and look over
    - Submiter: Submits the work

    Everyone is repsonsible for completing all work on time.

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    We can communicate as a team and let each other know when a problem arises. Any team members that may not be contributing should be respectfully addressed.

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    We will communicate effectively with each other and discuss our options for solutions. We will give everyone the spotlight and chance to voice their opinons and ideas then we will together come up with a combined solution. If there comes a conflict in which everyone cannot come to a single conclusion and/or agreement on an issue, we will have a majority vote to decide the answer.

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    When we have a conflict as a team or when someone is not doing their work properly.

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? Maybe you team needs a _fun_ clause...

    **Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

We can compliment each other on what we did well after finishing each milestone/project.

## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
