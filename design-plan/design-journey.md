# Group Project: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.

Our proposed website is a perfect fit because we will be providing the client with exactly what she wants her clients to get out of when visiting the site. We plan to have a 3 page site: the Home page with an overall preview of who the baker is and the baker's goals and accomplishments; A page with a gallery to showcase the baker's works and let clients know what's available, as well as having a direct link at the bottom (will be a google form) that will allow the audience to book the baker or inquire about catering; and a FAQ page to address any questions or concerns the audience may have.


## Plan/Schedule (Milestone 1)
> Make a plan of when you will complete all parts of this assignment.

> **Tip:** Your team should plan to work ahead. This project really isn't feasible to complete the night before a deadline.


We will meet this Sunday at 8:30pm (our usual meeting time) in order to discuss further about specifics surrounding the user interviews and our audience and we will plan the user interview questions and schedule a time to confuct the interviews. We will use the discussion time to analyze are audience's goals drawing conclusions form our interview notes and we will finalize a concrete idea of our site's audience. We will do the website exploration section exploring the example websites on our own. We will use our next Sunday meeting to plan out our website, starting with planning and organizing our sites content and then creating the card sorting iterations. We will also take this time to plan the navigation of the webpages and brainstorm the theme of our website. We will schedule another meeting in order to plan the interactivity of the website and create the layout exploration final sketches for our website. We will also schedule a meeting with our client for feedback and minutes. The follow up Sunday meeting will consist of working on going over our implementations of the website and we will discuss our plans for the rest of the week for dividing up the work for implementation. Finally, we will conduct the user testing and spend the last few days before the deadline finalizing our answers.

Goal 1: Design/ Appeal

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  We will Design the Site to use warm and inviting colors like pastel shades, light pinks, and creamy whites. We will incorporate colors that evoke feelings of sweetness and freshness. We will also use photos of some of our cient's best works.

- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  The color palette sets the tone and mood of the bakery website. Inviting colors such as the ones we chose create a cozy and appetizing atmosphere, making users more likely to explore your offerings. High-quality images showcase the products effectively, enticing users and encouraging them to make a purchase.

Goal 2: Price

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  We will display a clear and easily understandable pricing structure. Use concise and straightforward language to describe each product or service.

- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
 Clarity in pricing eliminates confusion for visitors. Users should quickly grasp the cost of individual items or services without having to navigate through complex menus.

Goal 3: Quality
**Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
   We will use, high-resolution images of products from the baker and incorporate a clean and elegant design that reflects the sophistication of the bakery we are trying to represent.

- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
 Quality imagery is essential for showcasing the details, textures, and freshness of your products. It establishes an immediate visual impression of the high standards the bakery maintains. Aslo, having a sophisitcated feel to the website  conveys professionalism and attention to detail, reflecting positively on the perceived quality of your bakery items.


### Audience (Milestone 2)
> Briefly explain your site's audience.
> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group with regard to your website.

The bakery website's primary audience comprises individuals residing in the local community and those seeking bakery services for special occasions. This group is cohesive due to their geographical proximity, emphasizing a sense of local connection and support. The website caters to individuals planning events, celebrations, or seeking baked goods for personal enjoyment, fostering a shared interest in event-based needs. The active community engagement of the bakery owner, Diaraye Jalloh, through local bake sales, extends to the online platform, enhancing the audience's cohesion. The local audience is likely to share common cultural backgrounds and taste preferences, allowing the website design to resonate with their cultural context. Designing with a focus on simplicity and easy navigation addresses the common accessibility needs of this cohesive group, ensuring that the website is tailored to meet their specific expectations and goals.


Identify three websites (preferably static websites) that exist today on the web to draw inspiration from. Please select websites that are similar to the website you wish to create.

This website includes a nav bar with a drop down menu for the menu tab, including a button saying "ORDER NOW" linking to a page with booking information. Common interactivity includes a hamburger menu with a side bar and icon when the screen is narrow  There are many flexboxes incorporated to highlight different sections in addition to a footer on the homepage. Interactivity also include more buttons leading to other webpages and those webpages also have buttons leading to other websites, and there is also a search bar, a cart logo which links to the customer's cart with their purchases, and a bar to enter their email to sign up to get updates. Additionally, since there are many different webpages and buttons with links to different webpages the logo in the navigation bar links to the home page so the user can find their way back if they get lost, enhancing the user experience. Additionally, there is a consistent pink and beige warm colored theme and similar typography and styling is used throughout the website.

### Example Website 2 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

Common design patterns includes hamburger menu with a side bar and icon when the screen is narrow, and many side by side flexboxes with links to other pages. Most of the website content is centered and the website contains a footer with all the webpage links visible which goes across all the pages of the website, which provides consistency, and there are also social media logos with links to the website's social media accounts. In terms of interactivity, the website includes many pictures of desserts which act as a button which links to another webpage which an enlarged picture of this dessert and more information about it. This website also includes a logo which links back to the homepage, which is a common design pattern, and the typogrphy is bold and striking, and the ivory background with the contrasting dark colored fonts and black footer also gives the website a very clear and eye-catching look. However, there are hints of brown and warmer colors and the softer font type balances out this contrast.

### Example Website 3 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

Common design patterns include a hamburger menu in which the icon appears in the narrow screen and leads to a drop down and a footer across all pages in the website with the different images and links to the company's social medias. Interactivity also inclues a drop down menu for different nav bar menu items including a search bar to search for specific information or aspects of the website. There is also a section to sign up for their email, which is also a common theme that I have noticed across all the different websites. The site is extremely loud and eye-catching as the fonts are big black and bold contrasting with a white background, and there are many flexboxes that are lined up horizontally that are colors of the rainbow. The website also uses different smiling pictures ond descriptions of their bakers, with their all - capitalized text and most of the website centered which enhances the user experience by highlighting the important information and maintaining the user's attention throughout the different pages of the website.

![Iteration 2](screenshots&cardsorting/iteration2.jpeg)

The second iteration is split into 5 main categories: home, menu, gallery, review, and FAQ. The 'home' page will contain a short introduction about the client who is the owner of the bakery along with a picture of herself and a logo. It will also have instructions on how to book an order and the location/time and delivery options. The menu page will contain the prices, few representative pictures of the baked goods along with their prices and names. The gallery page will contain picutres of her work. The reviews page would have reviews by customers. The FAQ page would contain answers to the questions that customers may have about the bakery. Every page will contain the order button and contacts about the baker at the footer of every page.


### Final Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Which iteration of card sorting will you use for your website?

We are planning to use the first card iteration.

> Explain how the final organization of content is appropriate for your site's audiences.

This organization makes sense for the audience since pages are organized into categories that a person looking to purchase baked goods from the site will find helpful and will look for.


### Navigation (Milestone 2)
> Please list the pages you will include in your website's navigation.

- Home
- Menu
- Gallery
- Reviews/FAQ

> Explain why the names of these pages make sense for your site's audience.

Home will contain a short information about the baker and instructions how to book. This will introduce the audience to the baker and inform them about the process of booking. The menu page will contain the list of items that they order and buy. The gallery contains the photo of her works which will give the audience a idea of the work and baked goods that she makes. The reviews/FAQ page will help the audience know if it's the type of a bakery they are looking for and answers to questions that they may have about the bakery.


## Visual Theme (Milestone 2)
> Discuss several (more than two) ideas about styling your site's theme. Explain why the theme ideas are appropriate for your target audiences. Note the theme you selected for your site and why it's appropriate for the audience and their goals.

Theme 1:

For an alternative theme, we might consider a more minimalist approach. The color scheme could involve muted pastels, creating a soft and sophisticated visual appeal. Shapes would be clean and modern, focusing on simplicity to provide a sleek and contemporary look. Typography would lean towards a modern sans-serif font, promoting readability and a sense of modernity. Imagery would involve high-quality, close-up shots of the baked goods, emphasizing their textures and details. This theme would be appropriate for an audience that appreciates a more modern and refined aesthetic. It caters to those who find beauty in simplicity and sophistication, potentially attracting customers looking for a high-end bakery experience.

Theme 2:

Another theme idea could revolve around a vintage-inspired design. The color palette might include warm tones such as beige, cream, and soft yellows, giving a nostalgic and comforting feel. Shapes would incorporate classic elements, and typography might involve script fonts or serif styles to evoke a sense of tradition and timelessness. Imagery would include vintage-style pictures, perhaps with a subtle sepia tone, capturing the essence of classic baking. This theme would be suitable for an audience that appreciates tradition and the charm of vintage aesthetics. It could attract customers seeking a bakery with a long-standing history or a timeless appeal, emphasizing the client's experience and dedication to the craft.


Theme 3 (The selected theme)
For our selected theme, we have chosen a color scheme dominated by pink and white with hints of brown, evoking a warm and inviting atmosphere. The choice of these colors aligns with the euphoric and delightful vibe that our client, Diaraye Jalloh, aims to convey through her bakery. Pink symbolizes sweetness and creativity, while white brings in a sense of purity and cleanliness, essential in the context of a bakery. The addition of hints of brown complements these colors, providing a touch of earthiness and warmth. In terms of shape, we opt for curved edges, giving a soft and approachable feel to the overall design. The typography we envision is fancy and appealing, with bolded words strategically used for contrast and emphasis. This choice ensures that important information, such as product names and key details, stands out. The imagery will consist of many different pictures of our client's cupcake creations, showcasing the variety and quality of her baked goods. Including the client's logo reinforces brand identity. This theme is appropriate as it reflects the warmth and creativity of a bakery, resonating with our target audience's desire for a visually pleasing and enjoyable experience.


## Design (Milestone 2)

Document your site's layout.

## Interactivity Brainstorm (Milestone 2)
> Using the audience goals you identified, brainstorm possible options for interactivity to enhance the functionality of the site while also assisting the audience with their goals.
> Briefly explain idea each idea and provide a brief rationale for how the interactivity enhances the site's functionality for the audience.
> Note: You may find it easier to sketch for brainstorming. That's fine too. Do whatever you need to do to explore your ideas.

- Hamburger menu: Users are able to click the hamburger menu icon which would open up pages. The pages would be displayed vertically and would be used in narrow screens.
- Click on "order" button that leads to google form: Users would press on the order button on the nav bar which would lead to a google form that they can use to order.
- Pop up of bigger photo when clicked on: The photo on the homepage would have a pop up of an enlarged photo when clicked on.
- Thumbnail gallery: The gallery page would be in a grid format. When the user presses the photo, they would be able to see the photos in a thumbnail gallery with the enlarged photos.


### Layout Exploration (Milestone 2)
> Iterate on your site's design through sketching.
> Sketch both the narrow and wide versions of the site.
> Here you are just exploring your layout ideas. You don't need to sketch every page.
> Include some of your interactivity ideas in your sketches.
> Provide an explanation for each sketch explaining the idea and the design patterns you are leveraging.

![Narrow Sketch Homepage](sketches/narrowsketchhomepage.jpeg)
Narrow Sketch Homepage: I wanted to implement a hamburger drop down menu with an icon in order to display a common design pattern and I wanted to include a modal for the Logo in which the modal is an enlarged photo of the logo, because I realized it is very hard to see the words on the logo. In term of the design and structure of the page, I used the kays bakery website as my inspiration using a pattern of side by side flexbox and normal blocks and putting the introduction next to the Logo picture.

![Wide Sketch Homepage](sketches/widesketchhomepage.jpeg)
Wide Sketch Homepage: For the wide version, I wanted to contrast so I put the nav elements all next to each other and I made the hamburger icon go away for common design patterns and I wanted to include a modal for the Logo in which the modal is an enlarged photo of the logo, because I realized it is very hard to see the words on the logo. In term of the design and structure of the page, I used the kays bakery website as my inspiration using a pattern of side by side flexbox and normal blocks and putting the introduction next to the Logo picture, and the wide version also responsive so the sizes of the images and text grow bigger.

![Narrow and Wide Sketch Menu](sketches/menuexploration.jpg)
The wide version of menu would have a representative photo and the name of the items and price underneath the photo. The narrow version would be the same format except that it would be responsive and shrink the image and text accordingly to the screen size.

![Wide Sketch Gallery](sketches/galleryexploration.jpg)
The wide gallery would have the photo layed out in a grid format. When clicked on a photo, the thumbnail gallery would appear which is the second sketch.

![Narrow Sketch Gallery](sketches/galleryexplorationnarrow.jpg)
The narrow gallery would have the photos layed out vertically. The thumbnail gallery would appear when the photo is clicked.

![Narrow Sketch Reviews/Faq](sketches/narrowreviews.jpg)
The narrow version should have the text in the page fit to the screen without users having to scroll side to side to read the text.

![Wide Sketch Reviews/FAQ](sketches/widereviews.jpg)
The wide version would have all the text across the enteitre screen and centered.

### Final Design (Milestone 2)
> Include the final sketches for each of your pages.
> **Include your final interactivity in your sketches.** Include annotations to explain what happens when the user takes an action with your interactivity.
> The sketches must include enough detail that another 1300 student could implement them.
> Please provide an explanation for each sketch.

**Narrow Design:**

![Final Narrow Sketch Menu](sketches/menufinalnarrow.jpg)
The hamburger menu will make the different site pages appear and close by pressing the button. The picutres and texts would be in a vertical format.

![Final Narrow Sketch Gallery](sketches/galleryfinalnarrow.jpg)
The images would be in a vertical format and the thumbnail gallery would appear when the photo is pressed. They would be able to exit out by pressing the x button.

![Final Narrow Sketch Homepage](sketches/finalnarrowsketchhomepage.jpeg)
Final Narrow Sketch: I aimed to incorporate a hamburger dropdown menu with an icon to showcase a widely recognized design pattern. Additionally, I included a modal for the logo, featuring an enlarged photo to address the difficulty of reading the words on the logo. Inspired by the design and structure of the Kay's Bakery website, I utilized a layout pattern involving side-by-side flexboxes and conventional blocks. This approach positioned the introduction alongside the logo picture, contributing to a visually appealing and user-friendly page structure.

Website Revision after user testing: Put the booking-section into a flex box and made it a different color including making the font white and adding styling such as a gray shadow. I also lined up that section with the intro section and also lined up the nav elemented with the logo and evenly spaced them.

![Final Narrow Reviews/FAQ](sketches/narrowreviewsfaq.jpg)
The text will remain centered and be able to fit fully on the screen. There will also be a hamburger menu implemented in the nav bar which won't hide the text when it's pressed. The nav bar will show and hide the other pages of the site when pressed.

**Wide Design:**

![Final Wide Sketch Menu](sketches/menufinalwide.jpg)
There would be a representative photo of the category and the list of item names and prices would be underneath the photos.

![Final Wide Sketch Gallery](sketches/galleryfinalwide.jpg)
The photos would be in a grid layout and when pressed, the thumbnail gallery would appear. The thumbnail gallery would enable users to see the enlarged photo. They would be able to exit out by pressing the x button.

![Final Wide Sketch Homepage](sketches/finalwidesketchhomepage.jpeg)
Wide Sketch Homepage: To create a distinctive look for the wide version, I opted for a contrasting approach by aligning the navigation elements side by side and eliminating the hamburger icon, adhering to common design patterns. I introduced a modal for the logo, featuring an enlarged photo to address the legibility issue with the words on the logo. Drawing inspiration from the Kay's Bakery website, I employed a design pattern involving side-by-side flexboxes and conventional blocks for the page's structure. The introduction is strategically placed next to the logo picture for a cohesive layout. Moreover, the wide version is designed to be responsive, ensuring that both images and text dynamically scale for an optimal viewing experience.

![Final Wide Reviews/FAQ](sketches/widereviewsfaq.jpg)
All text will be centered throughout the page and the nav bar will have an order button on the nav bar that give users access to the order form.


### Design Rationale (Milestone 2)
> Explain why your design is appropriate for your audience.
> Specifically, why does your content organization, navigation, and site design/layout meet the goals of your users?
> How did you employ **design patterns** to improve the familiarity of the site for your audience?

This website is appropriate for the audience because the content adresses the needs of the audience. The vibrant pink and white give lighthearted and sweet vibes that are appropriate for a bakery. The different types of content are placed under pages that are named appropiately.  The "Home" page introduces the audience to the theme of the website, the owner of the company, and gives instructions on how to book with the them. The "Menu" page gives the audience a list of products that the company provides along with pictures and prices of the products. The "Gallery" page features pictures of works from the company. The "Reviews/FAQ" page adresses commonly asked questions which is convenient for the audience. This page also provides them with reviews so that they can better form their opinion on the company based on the experience of others.


## Interactivity Rationale (Milestone 2)
> Describe the purpose of your proposed interactivity.
> Provide a brief rationale explaining how your proposed interactivity addresses the goals of your site's audience and enhances their user experience.

Our interactivity consists of a hamburger menu, a thumbnail gallery, and an order button. The hamburger menu serves to accommodate users that are viewing the website with a narrow screen. The menu allows the navigation system to fit in the page without taking up a monstrous amount of space. A thumbnail gallery allows the audience to see pictures and enlarge them if interested. The order button will send the audience to a link that allows them to order products from the company.


## Interactivity Plan (Milestone 2)
> Now that you've designed your interactivity for your site, you need to plan how you will implement it.
> Describe how you will implement the interactivity. This should be a complete plan that another 1300 student could use to implement the interactivity.
> You should list the HTML elements, CSS classes, events, pseudocode, and the initial state.
